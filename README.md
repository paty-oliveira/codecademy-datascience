# Data Science Projects

This repository has as main goal the practising of Data Science tools and analytical mindset. This will allow me to improve
my technical and analytical skills, while I am challenging myself.

The projects are from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/projects). The approach for each project should keep the same baseline, i.e.:

- Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis
- Inspecting the data before any visualization
- Create a common library for the most used functions and use them during the analysis
