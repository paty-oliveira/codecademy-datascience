# Yelp Rating Predictor

## Project Goals

The restaurant industry is tougher than ever, with restaurant reviews blazing across the internet from day one
of a restaurant’s opening.
But as a lover of food, you and your friend decide to break into the industry and open up your own restaurant,
Danielle’s Delicious Delicacies.

Since a restaurant’s success is highly correlated with its reputation, you want to make sure Danielle’s Delicious
Delicacies has the best reviews on the most queried restaurant review site: Yelp! While you know your food will be
delicious, you think there are other factors that play into a Yelp rating and will ultimately determine your
 business’s success.

With a dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp ratings, you decide to use a Multiple Linear
Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant’s Yelp rating and predict the Yelp rating
for your restaurant!


In this project, we’ll be working with a real dataset provided by Yelp. We have provided six files, listed below with a brief description:

- yelp_business.json: establishment data regarding location and attributes for all businesses in the dataset
- yelp_review.json: Yelp review metadata by business
- yelp_user.json: user profile metadata by business
- yelp_checkin.json: online checkin metadata by business
- yelp_tip.json: tip metadata by business
- yelp_photo.json: photo metadata by business
